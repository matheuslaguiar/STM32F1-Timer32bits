# STM32F1-Timer32bits
Creating a 32 bits Timer resolution using two 16 bits timers to achieve.

This project uses this Application Note (by STmicroelectronics) as reference:
https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an2592-achieving-32bit-timer-resolution-with-software-expansion-for-stm32cube-and-standard-peripheral-library-stmicroelectronics.pdf

We are using the microcontroller STM32F103C8T6.
